## The challenge

DESCRIPTION

- [ ] Build a small app to explore the latest blocks on Ethereum. The goal of the app is to provide a way to glance at the recent Ether transfers happening on the blockchain.

REQUIREMENTS

- [ ] Display at least the ten latest blocks.
- [ ] Allow the user to see the transactions from a block. Only the transactions sending Ether should be displayed.
- [ ] Allow the user to see some details about a transaction.
- [ ] Bonus: any extra feature you find relevant, useful or interesting.

NOTES

- [ ] You can use any library you feel comfortable with.
- [ ] The app will be loaded in a browser with MetaMask.
- [ ] Feel free to interpret the requirements in any way that you think could be interesting.
- [ ] The app doesn’t need to follow the Aragon visual identity but you can use the aragonUI.
- [ ] Don’t hesitate to ask any question to the team :-)

THE SUBMISSION WILL BE EVALUATED ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS:

- [ ] We'll pay special attention to the visual and UI choices and implementation.
- [ ] Code quality / readability / testability.
- [ ] Perceived performance.
- [ ] Accessibility.
- [ ] We expect the implementation to be pretty straight forward, so definitely surprise us with any extra!
- [ ] Send us the Github repo and live demo link once completed.
